# Subsystems to port (in order ig)
- [ ] WAD loader - started 19/12/2025 (dd/mm/aa).
    >My assumption is that audio is implemented with SDL_mixer and that it will work OOTB. After loading the WAD, it goes to the game. End result should be: black screen, no controls but audio should work (which means WADs get loaded correctly)

- [ ] HW Renderer
- [ ] Input

# Nice features to have (after the MVP)
- [ ] Modify launch args
- [ ] Selector of WAD files
- [ ] Keyboard to submit cheats
- [ ] Play MP3 audio instead of MIDI
- [ ] Networking on LAN (i.e. Local wireless function that's used in download mode)
- [ ] Renderer: add 3D support
